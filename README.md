# Investigating the use of generative adversarial networks to augment small datasets
Reupload of code used for my masters thesis: Investigating the use of generative adversarial networks to augment small datasets. Originally forked from: https://github.com/sangwoomo/FreezeD and credit to the authors of [Freeze the Discriminator: a Simple Baseline for Fine-Tuning GANs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.10964), Sangwoo Mo, Minsu Cho, Jinwoo Shin.

The project used the GesATional Dataset provided my supervisor Mercedes Torres Torres based on her previous work: [Postnatal gestational age estimation of newborns using Small Sample Deep Learning](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0262885618301483).

Multiple GAN models were trained using the FreezeD and TransferGAN techniques, which were then utilized to generate images to augment datasets when training ResNet-18 models to observe whether performance improved.
